            <p>NOTE: This is just a temporary page, the contents do not reflect my overall design of the website. Thanks!<br><br>Over the course of the Nextech Catapult program, my projects have been centered over a common industry, the music industry. Currently, I am entering a new development stage in which I am integrating the projects I have created into a fully functioning and public website that incorporates a new design layout and the addition of my quiz and Spotify API projects into my website. While I am finished with these projects, I want to hold off in showing these until the final product, although if you watched my presentation, I hope you got a good glimpse at what this project will end up as. I will include some images here to show different current design aspects, but keep in mind that this project is going to reach a completely revamped stage with my current increased knowledge of coding.</p>

<div class="progress">
    <p>As for my Legacy Editions found on the 'About This Website' page, although I currently have working editions of these pages, I would like to separate them into separate repositories so that they do not add unnecessary content to my files, which is why I purposely did not put links to those versions yet. I will have the updated versions out shortly. As for my future projects, I am looking forward to working in a new internship this next year, and I am currently open for hiring. After winning the best overall portfolio for the Nextech Catapult program, I am ready to progress my skills to the next level. For example, I am in the process of working with the <a href="https://boomeranglearning.wixsite.com/boomerang-learning" target="_blank"style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 2px; text-decoration-thickness: 2px; color: #fff;">Boomerang Learning</a> team to develop an AI-based education website. You can view the basic product demo with the previous link. I will add more to my portfolio as I progress through these changes. Thanks for taking a look at my website!</p>
